 * <p>Deletes the specified inline policy that is embedded in the specified IAM
 *             group.</p>
 *          <p>A group can also have managed policies attached to it. To detach a managed policy from
 *             a group, use <a>DetachGroupPolicy</a>. For more information about policies,
 *             refer to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed policies and inline
 *                 policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { IAMClient, DeleteGroupPolicyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-iam"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { IAMClient, DeleteGroupPolicyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-iam"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new IAMClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteGroupPolicyRequest
 *   GroupName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   PolicyName: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteGroupPolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteGroupPolicyCommandInput - {@link DeleteGroupPolicyCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteGroupPolicyCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteGroupPolicyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteGroupPolicyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link IAMClientResolvedConfig | config} for IAMClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link LimitExceededException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was rejected because it attempted to create resources beyond the current
 *       Amazon Web Services account limits. The error message describes the limit exceeded.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link NoSuchEntityException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was rejected because it referenced a resource entity that does not exist. The
 *       error message describes the resource.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ServiceFailureException} (server fault)
 *  <p>The request processing has failed because of an unknown error, exception or
 *       failure.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link IAMServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from IAM service.</p>
 *
 * @example To delete a policy from an IAM group
 * ```javascript
 * // The following command deletes the policy named ExamplePolicy from the group named Admins:
 * const input = {
 *   "GroupName": "Admins",
 *   "PolicyName": "ExamplePolicy"
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteGroupPolicyCommand(input);
